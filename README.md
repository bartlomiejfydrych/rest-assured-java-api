# 📑Information about this repository (for recruiters)

## 📄Description

### Introduction

Welcome to my repository, recruiters. Feel free to review its contents at your convenience.🙋‍♂️

This repository was created to structure and reinforce the knowledge I acquired during **the test automation course
conducted by "Sii Poland"**.

A separate repository will be allocated for **Frontend testing using Selenium.**

### About repository

This repository contains **API Tests using REST Assured and Java.**

I covered with tests **API** of the website **Piwik PRO**.

A description of the site and a list of things I learned are in the later sections of this document.

### Additional notes

Some of the comments in the repository are in Polish, so that when I come back to it, I can more easily remember and
understand what a given piece of code was about.

There are also comments in English to explain to you (recruiters) what a given piece of code is about and why I wrote
a certain method/test this way and not another.

I won't copy here what mechanisms their API consists of. Everything is in the documentation, in the above URL.
